		<p class="text-block">So you're planning on covering the app. First of all, thank you so much because this helps us get publicity and secondly here is some useful stuff and information.</p>
		<h1>Recommended things to note</h1>
		<p class="text-block">You do not have to listen to this paragraph but I could like it if you did. When installing and showing how to use the app I would like it for you to use the big download button and tell the users how use the pureurls link and to not show off the mirrors since I don't make money that way but these are just recommendations. Also I would like an honest review so if the app is bad, say it is but I doubt you will say that.</p>
		<h1>Images/Colors</h1>
		<p class="text-block">Note: You may not claim our icon/logo as your own, credit must be given in the fact that is is our icon/logo.</p>
		<h1>Colors</h1>
		<p class="text-block">Dark Blue: #1d61ef</p>
		<p class="text-block">Light Blue: #1ad5fc</p>
		<h1>Images</h1>
		<p class="text-block">The image is square, the corners are rounded and a shadow is added on the browser.</p>
